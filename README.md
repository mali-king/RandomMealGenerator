#Meal Generator
This program is a meal generator that suggests a healthy meal based on a user's current weight.
It is implemented using the PyQt5 library, which allows for the creation of graphical user interface (GUI) applications.

#Class Definitions
The program defines a MealGenerator class, which represents the GUI window for the meal generator. The MealGenerator class has the following methods:

__init__: This is the constructor method for the class. It sets up the UI elements, including a label to prompt the user for their weight, 
a line edit for the user to enter their weight, a button to generate a meal, and a label to display the generated meal. 
It also creates a layout to organize the UI elements and connects the generate button to the generate_meal method. 
Finally, it sets the window title and size.

generate_meal: This method is called when the generate button is clicked. 
It reads the current weight from the weight input field, generates a random meal from a list of options, 
updates the meal label with the generated meal, and saves the current weight to a file.

#Running the Program
To run the program, the QApplication class is instantiated and the MealGenerator class is instantiated and shown. 
The program enters the main event loop by calling the exec_ method on the QApplication instance. 
This allows the program to process events and update the GUI.
